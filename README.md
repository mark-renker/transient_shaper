# Audio Transient Shaper

This project implements a real-time audio transient shaper for Tiny Tapeout. It enhances or reduces the attack and sustain portions of audio signals using envelope-based processing.

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

## How it works

The transient shaper processes audio in real-time by:

1. **Dual Envelope Detection**: Uses separate fast and slow envelope followers to track signal dynamics
2. **Attack Enhancement**: Boosts the initial transient portion of audio signals when enabled
3. **Sustain Modulation**: Separately controls the sustained portion of the signal
4. **Real-time Processing**: Operates at 24MHz for low-latency audio processing

## Interface

- **Input**: 6-bit audio input + 2 control bits (attack enable, sustain enable)
- **Output**: 8-bit processed audio output
- **Clock**: 24MHz
- **Reset**: Active-low asynchronous reset

### Pin Configuration

- `ui_in[5:0]`: Audio input (6-bit unsigned)
- `ui_in[6]`: Sustain amount control
- `ui_in[7]`: Attack amount control
- `uo_out[7:0]`: Processed audio output (8-bit)

## Testing

The design includes comprehensive testbenches for simulation. Run tests with:

```bash
cd test
make
```
